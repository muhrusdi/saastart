### Which browsers does Stitches support?

Stitches works on all modern browsers. Edge (Chromium), Chrome, Safari, Firefox - last 2 versions, at least.

Specifically, Stitches will work in browsers whose JavaScript engines support `Symbol` and `Set`.
The experience of complex, recursive nesting styles will only be visible to browsers whose CSS engines support `:is()`.

### Is Stitches limited to React?

No. You can use `@stitches/core` with Vue, Svelte, Angular, etc. It's framework agnostic. The main difference between this and the React wrapper is that it returns class name functions, instead of components.

### Where can I see Stitches used in production?

You're looking at it!

This website is built using Stitches, more precisely, using [components](https://github.com/radix-ui/design-system) from a design system built using Stitches.
