## Performance improvements

We've switched the style injection strategy to rely on CSSOM. This alone yielded huge performance gains. Additionally, we added extra layers of caching and memoizations.

### Style injection

One way to demonstrate our new injection method is by injecting CSS into a page one style at a time and checking that the later styles are injected as fast or faster than the first injection.

Here's a comparison of the 1000th style injection between Stitches `v0.1.9` and Sitches `v0.2.0`.

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Stitches 0.2.0', value: 0.2 },
    { name: 'Stitches 0.1.9', value: 34.78 },
  ]}
/>
}

### Component total lifecycle

Weâ€™ve reduced the time it takes to create and mount components. Every component you create is now faster.

Here's a comparison between Stitches `v0.1.9`, Stitches `v0.2.0`:

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Stitches 0.2.0', value: 1.72 },
    { name: 'Stitches 0.1.9', value: 2.79 },
  ]}
/>
}

### Updating `css` prop

The `css` prop is useful for setting styles at the consumption layer. These styles need to be converted to CSS rules and injected to the DOM. This needs to happen fast...and it does!

Here's a comparison between Stitches `v0.1.9` and Stitches `v0.2.0`:

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Stitches 0.2.0', value: 1.06 },
    { name: 'Stitches 0.1.9', value: 1.46 },
  ]}
/>
}

### Dynamic styles

In this test, we render the Sierpinski Triangle. Each node is a different color, to ensure styles are dynamic.

Here's a comparison between Stitches `v0.1.9` and Stitches `v0.2.0`:

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Stitches 0.2.0', value: 29.54 },
    { name: 'Stitches 0.1.9', value: 216.65 },
  ]}
/>
}

### Realistic page

Finally, this last test creates a full landing page, including responsive styles, tokens, variants. The test was based on the Stitches homepage.

Here's a comparison between Stitches `v0.1.9` and Stitches `v0.2.0`:

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Stitches 0.2.0', value: 15.51 },
    { name: 'Stitches 0.1.9', value: 55.42 },
  ]}
/>
}

## Benchmarks
